# CelOS

There are currently two CelOS varients. CelOS Maple and CelOS Rhino.

* CelOS Maple - CelOS Maple is a LTS Distribution which values stability, based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

* CelOS Rhino - CelOS Rhino is a rolling release distribution based on Ubuntu which values bleeding-edge updates.

Both CelOS versions have Flatpak at the heart of the system, for a great range of applications, frequent stable updates and security.

* The files for each seperate varient of CelOS have been seperated into different folders.
