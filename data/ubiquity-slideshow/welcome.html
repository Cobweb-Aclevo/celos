<p>CelOS aims to be a distribution which works for everyone. We want to provide a beautiful, simple, stable and secure desktop. We are based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to provide that stability. Flatpak is at the heart of everything CelOS does, and most core applications installed on your system will likely be installed via Flatpak.</p>
